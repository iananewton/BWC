Distillery Proof-Gallon Management

These JS files I keep and implement into a WordPress site in order to have an extremely low-cost solution for distillery proof-gallon management. This means that our ERP that manages proof-gallonage meticuously and really makes the dauntint monthly tax reporting a breeze costs us, per year, the cost of our web domain and cheap GoDaddy Hosting (all < $150 per year).

THIS is how you make small business run like a big business for stupidly low costs without having to bring in expensive outside experts (read: "THIS is how you make your small business badass").
